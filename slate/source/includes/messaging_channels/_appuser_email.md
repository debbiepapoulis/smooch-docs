## Email Messaging

The Email channel allows you to have conversations with your users by email via any of your connected business systems, be it Slack, Front or a bot connected to the Smooch API.

When you enable the Email channel, you will be provided with a Smooch email address. Emails sent to that address will be delivered to your connected business systems.

### Using your own email address

After you set up your *from* address, all your messages to users will appear to come from your own email address instead of your Smooch email address.

1. To use your own email address to receive and respond to user emails, simply provide your email address in the "from address" field on the Smooch Email Channel page. ![input from address](/images/input_forwarding_email.png)

2. Configure your email provider to automatically forward incoming email to your Smooch email address (detailed instructions below).

3. Now click the _**Test email forwarding**_ link on the Email channel page (shown below) to confirm that forwarding is working.

#### Configuring your email provider to forward email to your Smooch email address

During configuration, your provider may send a confirmation email to your Smooch email address. It's important to have at least one business system set up on Smooch so that you can act on the confirmation email sent by your provider. For example, if you setup Gmail to forward to Smooch, you'll receive a message in your business system from the Gmail team, asking you to follow a link to confirm forwarding to your Smooch address.

### Sending and receiving files

Email attachments sent by the user will either be rendered in your business system, if they are images, or posted as hyperlinks, for other types of files.

Images sent to the user will be embedded in the email as html images.

### Receiving whispers

Whispers sent to email will contain a footer with an unsubscribe link. Like so:

<img src="/images/email_unsubscribe.png" alt="unsubscribe" style="max-width:520px;">

If the user clicks on this link, they will be permanently unsubscribed from further whispers, though they will still be able to receive non-whisper messages.
